# quantumgraph
Programs to compute eigenvalues for the wave equation on quantum graphs. Written originally in Matlab, in the process of rewriting to work with Octave and perhaps extending functionality in python. See the paper by Harrell and Demirel for the definition of the quantum graphs this code works with: https://arxiv.org/abs/0911.1896
